## Section I. What students understood

Since this was the first lab of the year, there wasn't a lot that the students did understand. Overall, they understood how to run Python code effectively, and understood how to preform basic operations, such as `print`, `def`, etc.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

Students struggled with the idea of namespacing variables. Many students had a hard time understanding why arguments were required, and why they couldn't access values from other functions. Additionally, some struggled with understanding stacktraces properly.

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

I think the assignment would be good in theory, but in practice the assignment was difficult for many to understand, to the point where I feel as though it detracted from the programming aspects. I do beliveve understanding tax code is important, but it seemed to be a major issue for many students.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

I learned how to ask leading questions to guide students' thinking, which was something that I hadn't had to do before. Additionally, I learned how to teach others through analogy, which was a helpful way of explaining some concepts.
