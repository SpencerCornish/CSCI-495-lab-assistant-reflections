## Section I. What students understood

Technically, we had a lab this week, but it did not contain much of anything substantive to report on. Most of the lab was introductions. One thing the students understood was how the assignment worked. We didn't help too much.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

The only issue we had was one student's environment, which was fixed with a switch to `python3`.

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

N/A, it was a perfect intro.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

I didn't learn much, but I feel like the introductions we all did helped me to know who I was working with and learn names.
