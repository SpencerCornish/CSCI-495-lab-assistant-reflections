## Section I. What students understood

This week's lab was about classes, and I feel as though most students felt pretty comfortable with all of the new content. They typically understood why classes existed, and how to manipulate data.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

Students struggled with the naming of variables, and how that differs from the naming of function definitions in the program. I think that some students would feel more comfortable with definite declarations, rather than implied ones in the constructor, but that is more of a language limitation rather than a class one.

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

Nope!

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

I feel as though this lab did what most do, and helped me to become a better asker of leading questions. This really helped the students to understand in their own ways.
