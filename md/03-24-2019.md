# Lab Reflection

## Section I. What students understood

This week, the students really did not need much help. They were totally capable of working on this lab. I only helped a couple of people.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

The only problems anyone really had were related to spelling errors, and properly returning the list when overriding the += operator. Otherwise, all was well!

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

Honestly, could be a little tougher. There were only ~10 people in the lab, and they were done in about 20 mins.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

I feel as though I didn't learn a lot about teaching from this lab. There really wasn't much teaching going on.
