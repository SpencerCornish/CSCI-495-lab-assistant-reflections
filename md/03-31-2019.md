## Section I. What students understood

This week, students worked on using numpy for the first time. Most students are beginning to understand how to use external libraries, and how useful those are. Additonally, most students understood the core concepts addressed for the whole semester, such as loops, functions, returns, etc.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

THe only thing students struggled with was the logic of writing a function that did lookaheads in the list of cards. This, for some reason, was very confusing. It may have been due to a lack of understanding of how straight hands worked, but it was the biggest sticking point of the whole lab.

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

More focus on how to use indexes in for loops may have been helpful for the students. Otherwise, I don't see any reasons this lab should be altered.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

In some ways, this lab tested my patience, which was a good experience. Some of the students could just not understand what they needed to do, so I had to find a new way to communicate what they needed to do to complete the assigment. All in all it was a good learning experience.
