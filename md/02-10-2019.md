## Section I. What students understood

This week, students had a presentation on their first programs. This was a very good insight into the areas at which the students struggled. What was clear, however, is the core concepts of programming were well understood by the class.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

A lot of the students were understandably confused about dictionaries, since they haven't learned it yet. Other than that, the main confusion was with not using any loops, but that was minimal. 

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

I see no oppurtunity for improvement, it was good.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

It was cool to see how others designed their solution, and how others came up with the same solutions independently. It helped me to see how many different ways there were to solve the same problem.
