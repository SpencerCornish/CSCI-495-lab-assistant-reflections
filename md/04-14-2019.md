## Section I. What students understood

This week's lab was all about learning to use various graphing libraries. This was so easy for the students, that most of them didn't attend either lab section I was present for, and those who were in attendance only had minor issues. They understood how to read the docs, and how to properly graph the data.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

The only issues experienced by the students in this lab were related to environment issues, and issues with setting the graph colors to alternate. All in all, the students understood most of their tasks.

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

Could be a bit tougher, but since it was before a holiday weekend, it was fine.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

This week, I learned how to help by asking good questions. Even though I only helped a few students, I really appreciated their feedback.
