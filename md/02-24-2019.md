## Section I. What students understood

During this lab, the students had a better understanding of the core concepts this week, and actually did okay when it came to dictionaries. The lab was relatively empty, and I think that most understood what was necessary.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

Some students continued to struggle with how `return` worked, and how functions worked. Dictionaries were actually one of the easiest tasks for most of the students.

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

I see no improvements necessary, it taught the concepts very well.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

Personally, I learned a lot more about how to help people who were slightly already frustrated. This is a valuable skill, as many people struggle to be helped when they are very frustrated.
