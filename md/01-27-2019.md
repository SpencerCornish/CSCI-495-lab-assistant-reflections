# Lab Reflection

## Section I. What students understood

This week, students sufficiently understood how to write iterative loops, as well as the other types. The assignment accurately taught all methods of iteration.

## Section II. What students didn't understand

As expected, students did not understand recursion right away. Luckily, They all learned very quickly, since typically it was all down to not understanding base cases, and ending up in infinite loops. All in all, a pretty painless lab for all involved.

## Section III. How the assignment that you helped out with might be improved

I don't see how this lab could be improved, to be honest. It was a really good way to introduce these concepts without an overload of extra stuff. It tested the students in the important places, without wasting time on the extras. I liked it.

## Section IV. What you personally learned with respect to one or more of the course outcomes listed in the next section

I learned how best to teach something I don't understand well. Frankly, I learned a lot based on what kind of questions the students asked. It really showed me how helpful teaching is to learn a concept even better than you already know it.
